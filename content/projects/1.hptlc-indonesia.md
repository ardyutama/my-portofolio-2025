### The Problem
[cite_start]Indonesian HPTLC researchers lacked a central, modern platform to document projects and showcase biodiversity data, leading to fragmented scientific collaboration[cite: 20].

### My Solution
I led the full project lifecycle, architecting a monolith application using **Laravel** for robust backend management and **Inertia.js + React** for a seamless, SPA-like frontend experience without the API overhead.

### The Outcome
[cite_start]The platform successfully centralized researcher data, resulting in a **35% increase in engagement** from the scientific community[cite: 97].
