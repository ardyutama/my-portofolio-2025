### The Problem
[cite_start]Processing real-time telemetry from electric buses generated over **100GB of data weekly**, overwhelming the legacy SQL infrastructure[cite: 103].

### My Solution
I co-led the engineering of a Big Data pipeline using **Apache Kafka** for ingestion and **Go (Golang)** for high-concurrency consumption. We implemented **Cassandra (NoSQL)** for write-heavy storage.

### The Outcome
[cite_start]The new pipeline handled the data velocity with zero downtime and improved API data consumption speeds by **20%**[cite: 102].
